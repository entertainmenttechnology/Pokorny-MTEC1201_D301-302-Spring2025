### COURSE DESCRIPTION  
This course introduces students to foundational programming concepts and techniques, with a focus on coding for creative applications. Students design, develop, and code interactive software experiences integrating computer graphics, image assets, text and fonts, and additional digital media. Programming for Interactive Media is the first in a sequence of coding courses for the Emerging Media Technology program, preparing students for advanced coursework in the program.
     

### LEARNING OUTCOMES       
For the successful completion of this course, a student should be able to:    
* Develop literacy for reading and writing in a coding language.  
* Recognize and articulate computational strategies used in contemporary interactive media projects.  
* Demonstrate learning and problem-solving methodologies, including use of coding reference, documentation materials, and flow charting.    
* Implement foundational coding concepts and techniques to realize interactive software experiences, including use of: variables, logical comparison, and arithmetic operators; conditionals, functions; loops; arrays; and an introduction to Object Oriented Programming.  
* Design, develop, debug, and iterate an interactive software experience from ideation through final project presentation.  
   
  
###  COURSE STRUCTURE  
The course combines lectures and presentations, critiques, discussions, and studio/lab time. Typically, students work on technical exercises each week, along with creative short study projects integrating these newly learned techniques. There will be two larger interactive software projects during the semester- a midterm and final project- largely independently driven, with iterative project development.            
    
Course materials and assignments will generally be posted to GitHub on Wednesdays of each week, due the following Wednesday before class begins. We will create small peer groups for extra tech support during and outside of class hours.    

  
## PROJECTS AND ASSIGNMENTS      
* Weekly readings and technical exercises, for developing programming foundations and building conceptual framework.   
* Weekly creative short study assignments, demonstrating programming proficiency and creative concept development. Students implement required technical parameters for each week, while engaging with a chosen creative theme.   
* Midterm project – a largely self-directed work exploring the topics covered in the first half of the semester, while expanding upon one or more short study assignments. These are multi-week, scaffolded projects with work-in-progress deadlines, peer playtesting, and final critiques.   
* Final project – a largely self-directed work, supported by independent research and iterative project development. Students present proposals for the instructor to green-light, which includes a calendar of tasks and deliverables. These are multi-week, scaffolded projects with work-in-progress deadlines, peer playtesting, and final critiques.   
  
  
## REQUIRED MATERIALS               
* A sketchbook, or paper to sketch with (does not need to be exclusive to this class)    
* A Mac or PC computer with internet access for assignments outside of class (either your own, or from a lab on campus)     
* Free software and accounts: Discord, Github, Visual Studio Code, Google Chrome Browser        
    
  
## EXPECTATIONS    
By signing up for this class, you are making a **commitment to fully participate, support your classmates as best you can, and do your part in creating a positive class environment**. For our course to run smoothly, everyone must:       
* **Show up to class on time**, ready to contribute.          
* **Check Discord** regularly for group and private messages.     
* **Check our class GitHub repo** regularly for posted assignments.          
* **Back up work** regularly.                
* Spend **at least 3-5 additional hours a week** (outside of class) on class projects and exercises. Midterm and Final Projects may require additional time, depending on your ambition. Budget more time each week than may be needed.              
* **Reach out** to your peer group and your instructor via Discord with questions.   
* **Push creatively and technically.** Stay open and curious.     

  
### COMMUNICATION   
* **To contact your instructor with a brief, private question or message**, send a DM (Direct Message) through Discord. This is preferred over email.  
* **If you have a question that may be relevant to the group**, post in the #general channel on Discord for all to see and comment on.      
* Use Discord for **easy communications with your classmates** as well—you can DM individuals or selected groups.  
* **To discuss a longer matter** with your instructor, set up an appointment for office hours.  
  

## PARTICIPATION POLICY (The Rules + Regulations for Keeping the Ship Sailing)     
* **We will begin promptly at the start of each class.**           
* As **our work is interdependent**, it is critical for everyone to be fully present, participating, and engaging in the course.   
* If absent from class, this will impact other students and lab activities. **If you will be late or absent, DM your instructor via Discord ASAP.**          
* **Absences may be excused in the following cases:** illness, religious observance with advanced notice, and on a case-by-case basis for other critical events and extenuating circumstances.         
* In the case of an absence, check GitHub and **contact a classmate to catch up** on what you missed. Contact the instructor if you have additional questions.  
* Each student is asked to play their part in supporting our class, by **contributing regularly to peer groups** via Discord, for feedback and technical support.               
* **Midterm and Final Project critiques are mandatory and cannot be made up.** Missing a critique will result in a deduction of one letter grade for the corresponding project.

## INCLUSIVITY 
Part I. Name + Pronoun Usage 
This course consists of individual work and group discussion. We must therefore strive to create an atmosphere of inclusion and mutual respect: all students will have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name recognized. If the class roster does not align with your name, gender, and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor.    

Part II. Inclusivity Statement
It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as an asset, resource, strength, and benefit, rather than a checklist item or worse, a hindrance. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. Feel free to reach out to me via email or Discord at any time about any issues concerning you or with any such ideas.
