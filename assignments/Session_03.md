## DUE WEDNESDAY, 3/5

-  Send me the URL to your class GitHub Repo on Discord

### **Familiarize Yourself with the following...**        
Variables:       
* Declarations [let](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/let/) and [const](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/const/). (Avoid declaring with "var", which you will see in older JS documentation.)       
* Overview of the concept "variable scope" (global, function, block) from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_scope.asp) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope)          
* Data types: [Number](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/Number/), [Boolean](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/Boolean/), [String](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/String/)
   
p5.js variables:      
* [width](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/width/) and [height](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/height) 
* [mouseX](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/mouseX) and [mouseY](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/mouseY)  
* [pmouseX](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/pmouseX) and [pmouseY](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/pmouseY) 
  
Operators:  
* \+ (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), = (assignment), ++ (increment), -- (decrement), += (addition assignment), -= (subtraction assignment)   
* (Find an overview of these arithmetic and assignment operators in the [Number](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/number/) reference.) 
 
Functions:  
* [setup()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/setup/) and [draw()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/draw/) 
* [print()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/print) and [console.log()](https://p5js.org/reference/console/log/)   
* [mousePressed()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/mousePressed)  
* [keyPressed()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/keyPressed)  
   

### **Short Study #2: Responsive Drawing**  
Create a responsive drawing using p5.js involving user input, inspired by the theme you have chosen for this series of sketches. You may use the previous assignment as a starting point, or begin a completely new sketch.

The drawing must react to the mouse and/or keyboard in some way and must include the following:
* use of at least two declared variables (named by you)    
* at least one of the following system variables: mouseX, mouseY, pmouseX, pmouseY   
* use of at least one arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /) 
* use of at least one value incrementing (increasing) or decrementing (decreasing) over time
* use of at least one event function: keyPressed() and/or mousePressed()      
* A developed concept and techniques moving beyond the in-class demos    
* //Comments at the top of your sketch, including: 
    * Your first name and last initial 
    * The title for your drawing    
    * A brief explanation of the concept or theme you are choosing to explore for the semester and how this sketch ties into it.   
    * Instructions for the user (for example, "press mouse to see the tree fall") 

Save the completed sketch as "SS2_[FirstName + Last Initial]" (for example, "SS2_IanP"). Push to your Class GitHub Repo **before the beginning of our next class** and also have the sketch ready to show for that class.
