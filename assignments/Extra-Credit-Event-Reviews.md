_This is a nudge to get you seeing work related to creative coding and emerging media in NYC._
  
Event reviews are extra credit. Reviews will be accepted until the end of the semester on 12/18. Choose any exhibition or event from the [Things to See](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/MTEC-Things-To-See) list or DM me with another suggestion to add to the list. If you are unsure if the event qualifies, DM me. _Events that you attend for another class cannot be used for this extra credit._   
  
Complete reviews submitted (up to 5) will receive **extra credit**. 
  
## Requirements:    
* Keep the **length** between 200-500 words.     
* **Include the following** in your review:   
  * What did you see, where was it, and who made it?    
  * Describe your experience in viewing and/or interacting with the work.
  * How is code integral to the work?   
  * Is the work reactive, interactive, participatory, and/or generative? Please describe.
  * What other context can you share about the work (here you might include the process of how it was made, software/hardware used, historical or contemporary context, more about the artist.... You may need to do some internet sleuthing if there's little info at the event itself).  
  * Did you find the work interesting or compelling? Why or why not?    
* **Include a selfie** (or photo taken by someone else) showing yourself with the work you are reviewing.     
* Spell check and **proofread** the review for grammar and clarity.  
* Send the review as a **PDF** document, via DM on Slack.  
  
You may review the same work as other students in the class (and I encourage you to go to events together), as long as you write your reviews separately and include your selfies.
