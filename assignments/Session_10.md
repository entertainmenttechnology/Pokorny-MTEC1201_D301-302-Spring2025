## Due Wednesday, 4/23

### REMINDER: SPRING BREAK NEXT WEEK -  NO CLASS 4/16

### **Familiarize Yourself with the following...**            
    
[array](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/Array/)     
.length (returns size of the array)   
[int()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/int/)     
   

### **Short Study #6: Arrays**    
Building upon your chosen theme, create a responsive sketch in p5.js. You may use the previous assignments as a starting point, or begin a completely new sketch.        
* At least two user-defined arrays.     
* User input.    
* A developed concept and techniques moving beyond the in-class demos.    
* The rest is up to you.    
* You may use the previous assignments as a starting point, or begin a completely new sketch.    
* Include as a comment at the top of your sketch: your name, title, any instructions for the user.          

Save the completed sketch as "SS6-[FirstName + Last Initial]" (for example, "SS6-IanP"). Submit to your Github Repo **before the beginning of class on 4/23**.      
   
## **Supplemental/Optional:**    
For video tutorials relating to this week's topics, check out The Coding Train:
* [arrays](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/7-arrays/1-arrays) (skip first part discussing objects, as we are not there yet, and start at timecode 1:43)    
* [arrays and loops](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/7-arrays/2-arrays-loops) 
   
_(Important reminder: Some of the older Coding Train videos use "var" for declaring variables, which is largely outdated and best to avoid. Instead, use "const" and "let" as appropriate.)_
