## Due before class on Wednesday, 4/30 

### **Familiarize Yourself with the following...**            
    
- [object](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/Object/)     
- [class](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/class/)    
 
### **Short Study #7: OOP**      
Choose one of your former sketches as a starting point, and create a new sketch that includes:  
* an original class with at least two original methods    
* at least three objects instantiated by the class 
* annotations as //comments in the sketch, explaining what each part does
* for an extra (optional) challenge, create an array of objects from your class    
* comments at the top of the sketch with your name, title of sketch, instructions to user, and which of your short study numbers you are building from in this assignment
   
Suggested work flow: create the class first with one object. Once it is working, add a second object. Then, optionally, add in the object array. I also recommend looking at functions that you have already created in past sketches, and practice converting your functions into classes. 

This will be your final short study before we move into final projects!
  
Save the completed sketch as "SS7-[FirstName + Last Initial]" (for example, "SS7-IanP"). Submit to your Github Class Repo **before the beginning of class on Wednesday 4/30**.      

### Final Project Proposal  
See [final project requirements]() for details. Submit pdf via DM on Discord **by Wednesday 4/30.**   

## **Supplemental/Optional:**  
Review object oriented programming concepts from our class demos as well as these videos from the Coding Train:  
* [Classes in JavaScript with ES6](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/6-objects/2-classes)  
* [Constructor Arguments with Classes](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/6-objects/3-constructor)  
* [Arrays of Objects](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/7-arrays/3-arrays-objects)       
  
Find additional examples on the p5.js website:  
* [objects](https://archive.p5js.org/examples/objects-objects.html)  
* [multiple objects](https://archive.p5js.org/examples/objects-multiple-objects.html)  
* [array of objects](https://archive.p5js.org/examples/objects-array-of-objects.html)  
* [another oop example](https://archive.p5js.org/examples/objects-objects-2.html)   
* [another oop example](https://archive.p5js.org/examples/objects-car-instances.html)    
* [yet another oop example](https://p5js.org/examples/classes-and-objects-snowflakes/)       
           
_Note: If you are referring to other resources for OOP, make sure you are looking at resources for JavaScript version ES6 or later._
