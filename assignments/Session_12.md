## Due before class on Wednesday, 5/7
### **Final Project: Work-In-Progress #1**  

This sketch must be runnable and ready to be playtested at the start of class. You can work on any aspect of your final project, and not all requirements need to be included for the WIP. The WIP should show about a week's worth of development towards the final project (at least 3-5 hours spent outside of class). Save the completed sketch as "Final-WIP1-[FirstName + Last Initial]" (for example, "Final-WIP1_IanP"). Submit to your Github Class Repo before start of class.

See [FINAL PROJECT](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Pokorny-MTEC1201_D301-302-Spring2025/blob/main/assignments/FINAL_PROJECT.md) for more details.
