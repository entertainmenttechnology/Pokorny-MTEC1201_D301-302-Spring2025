## Due before class on Wednesday, 5/14
### **Final Project: Work-In-Progress #2**  

This sketch must be runnable and ready to be playtested at the start of class. Your WIP should now show about two week's worth of development towards the final project (at least 6 to 10 hours spent outside of class). Save the completed sketch as "Final-WIP2-[FirstName + Last Initial]" (for example, "Final-WIP2_IanP"). Submit to your Github Class Repo before start of class.

See [FINAL PROJECT](https://github.com/entertainmenttechnology/Pokorny-MTEC1201_D301-302-Spring2025/blob/main/assignments/FINAL_PROJECT.md) for more details.
