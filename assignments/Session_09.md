## Due before class on Wednesday, 4/9


### **Familiarize Yourself with the following...**            
    
[while](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/while/)  
[for](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/for/)        
  

### **Short Study #5: Responsive Patterns**    
Building upon your chosen theme, create a **responsive** sketch in p5.js involving **user input** and iteration. You may use the previous assignments as a starting point, or begin a completely new sketch.      

**The sketch must include the following:** 
* At least one conditional statement 
* At least two for loops that create a pattern of some kind    
* A developed concept and techniques moving beyond the in-class demos   
* Include as a comment at the top of your sketch: your name, title, any instructions for the user  

**For an extra challenge:**
* Consider strategies for bringing more unpredictability to the sketch, for a more engaging experience.

Save the completed project as "SS5-[FirstName + Last Initial]" (for example, "SS5-IanP"). Submit to your class Github repo **before the beginning of class on 4/9**.   
  
## **Supplemental/Optional:**    
For video tutorials relating to this week's topics, check out [while and for loops](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/4-loops/1-while-for) on The Coding Train.  

Feeling extra ambitious? Try [nested loops](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/4-loops/2-nested)! Find another example of nested loops in demo 5 from this week's Open Processing demo collection. 
   
_(Important reminder: Some of the older Coding Train videos use "var" for declaring variables, which is largely outdated and best to avoid. Instead, use "const" and "let" as appropriate.)_
