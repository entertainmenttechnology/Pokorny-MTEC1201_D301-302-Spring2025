## DUE FRIDAY, 9/13

### **Familiarize Yourself with the following...**        
Resources on the p5.js website: 
* [p5.js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)       
* [p5.js examples](https://p5js.org/examples/)
* [p5.js tutorials](https://p5js.org/tutorials/) 

The basics:   
* [setup()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/setup/) 
* [createCanvas()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/createCanvas/)     
* [The coordinate system and shapes](https://archive.p5js.org/learn/coordinate-system-and-shapes.html)
 
Color, fill, stroke:      
_(There are multiple ways of inputting color values-- I recommend using r, g, b)._  
* [background()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/background/)  
* [fill()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/fill/) and [noFill()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/noFill/) 
* [stroke()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/stroke/), [noStroke()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/noStroke/), and [strokeWeight()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/strokeWeight/)    
* Check out this [color tutorial](https://archive.p5js.org/learn/color.html)

Shape:  
* In the "Shape" category, review all functions under "2D primitives" in the [p5.js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/).  
* Review [rectMode()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/rectMode/).   
* Optional / if feeling ambitious: check out functions under "Curves" and "Vertex" in the reference, along with this [curves tutorial](https://archive.p5js.org/learn/curves.html).  
   

_Find the in-class demos on our GitHub Repo in the demos folder._

  
### **Short Study #1: Beginning to Draw with Code**
Brainstorm a concept/theme that you would like to explore for a series of drawings made with code, to develop through weekly "short studies" with increasing complexity. For this first sketch of the series, create a static drawing using p5.js with 2D primitive shapes.   
 
_Projects must include:_ 
* A canvas width of at least 500 pixels, max 1920 pixels.  
* A canvas height of at least 500 pixels, max 1080 pixels.  
* At least 3 different types of primitives.  
* Variation in stroke weight and fill color.
* //Comments at the top of your sketch (where you are coding, not the canvas output), including: 
    * Your first name and last initial 
    * The title for your drawing    
    * A brief explanation of the concept or theme you are choosing to explore for the semester and how this first sketch ties into it.     

Save the completed sketch as "SS1_[FirstName + Last Initial]" (for example, "SS1_IanP"). Submit as a zip file (compress the project folder) and send via Discord DM **before the beginning of class on 9/26** and also have the sketch ready to show for that class.     

## **Supplemental/Optional:**  
For video tutorials relating to this week's topics, check out The Coding Train:  
* [Shapes and Drawing](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/1-intro/3-shapes-drawing) 
* [Color](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/1-intro/4-color)    
* [Comments](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/code-programming-with-p5-js/code/1-intro/6-comments)  

Play around with [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) for selecting R, G, B colors and palettes for your sketches.
